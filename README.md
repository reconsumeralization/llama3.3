# LLaMA 3.3 Fine-Tuning System

## Overview

The LLaMA 3.3 Fine-Tuning System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline the process of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on the LLaMA 3.3 architecture. This system provides an intuitive interface for data preparation, model configuration, training, evaluation, and deployment of fine-tuned models.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Upload, manage, and preprocess training datasets.
- **Model Configuration**: Easily configure hyperparameters and model settings.
- **Training Management**: Start, monitor, and manage fine-tuning jobs.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance with automated hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with various metrics and visualizations.
- **Model Export**: Export fine-tuned models in various formats (PyTorch, ONNX, TensorFlow).
- **Deployment**: Deploy fine-tuned models with a few clicks.
- **AI-Generated Data**: Generate synthetic training data using advanced AI models.
- **Ollama Integration**: Create and manage Ollama variants of your models.
- **Checkpointing**: Resume training from checkpoints for long-running jobs.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track model performance over time.
- **Version Control**: Manage different versions of your fine-tuned models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/reconsumeralization/llama-3.3-fine-tuning.git
   cd llama-3.3-fine-tuning
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-min-32-chars"
   GITHUB_ID="your-github-oauth-app-client-id"
   GITHUB_SECRET="your-github-oauth-app-client-secret"
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the application.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Navigate to the "Data Preparation" page.
   - Upload your dataset or use the AI-Generated Data feature to create synthetic data.
   - Use the Dataset Manager to organize and preprocess your data.

2. **Model Configuration**:
   - Go to the "Model Configuration" page.
   - Set up hyperparameters and model architecture options.

3. **Training**:
   - Start a new training job from the "Training" page.
   - Monitor progress and view real-time metrics.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess your fine-tuned model's performance on the "Evaluation" page.
   - Compare different models using the Model Comparison feature.

5. **Model Export and Deployment**:
   - Export your fine-tuned model using the Model Export options.
   - Deploy your model using the Deployment Wizard.
